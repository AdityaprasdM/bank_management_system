# bank_management_system
Bank Management System using Python implementing Object-Oriented Programming concepts such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism. Designed login authentication with PIN verification, transaction history, interest calculation, overdraft handling, and JSON-based data persistence.
# 🏦 Bank Management System (Python OOP Project)

A complete **Bank Management System** developed using Python implementing **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles such as inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.  

This project simulates real-world banking operations including account creation, login authentication, transactions, interest calculation, and overdraft handling.

This project is designed as a **resume-level project for Python Developer roles**.
